It was attributed to journalist Daniel Simone, who is working on a book about Manson. The Post reported that Burton and a friend wanted to display Manson's body in a ""bizarre California version of Lenin’s Tomb"" in order to ""draw huge crowds and make big money."" (Burton and Manson's marriage license recently expired.) Gawker's Antiviral blog did a good job of unpacking the claim, noting that neither Burton nor Manson have commented, and that nothing currently backs up Simone's claim. It's also worth noting that Simone is seeking a publisher for his book, and making this claim has given him attention for the project.
